# PMD Knowledge Graph Web Page

See: https://materialdigital.github.io/pmdkg/

The PMD Knowledge Graph enables exploration of the ontological framework based on [PMDco v2.0.7](https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology/tree/main), along with compatible application ontologies and alternative frameworks developed within the MaterialDigital Initiative. Using predefined SPARQL queries, everyone can investigate the T-Boxes of the named graphs.

The knowledge graph contains these [MaterialDigital Application Ontologies](https://github.com/materialdigital/materialdigital1_ontology_collection/tree/main).
